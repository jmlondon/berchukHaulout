This repository serves as the research compendium in support of the
above titled paper. As the manuscript works its way through peer review
and the publications process, additional reproducibility features
(e.g. Dockerfile, MyBinder.org) and an R/Shiny application to explore
results will be made available.

Major releases of the research compendium are published and archived
with Zenodo <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4638221>

## Draft Manuscript Under Active Development

Please note this manuscript is still in draft form and under active
development. Changes to results, code, and the manuscript are likely and
this **should not be cited without author permission**. We plan to
provide a preprint to [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) once internal
NOAA reviews and final revisions are completed.

## Contents

The **analysis** directory contains:

-   [:file_folder: paper](/analysis/paper): R Markdown source document
    for manuscript. Includes code to reproduce the figures and tables
    generated by the analysis. It also has a rendered as a PDF,
    [London_HauloutBehavior.pdf](https://github.com/jmlondon/berchukHaulout/blob/main/analysis/paper/London_HauloutBeahvior.pdf),
    suitable for reading (the code is replaced by figures and tables in
    this file)
-   [:file_folder: figures](/analysis/figures): figures generated
-   [:file_folder: templates](/analysis/templates): template files and
    scripts.

The **data** directory contains

-   [:file_folder: data](/data): data used for model fits and final
    model output

### {targets} and {renv} packages

This repository relies heavily on the {targets} and {renv} packages for
management of analysis pipelines and reproducibility.

-   [:file_folder: R](/R): pipeline functions developed in support of
    target pipeline
-   [:page_facing_up: \_targets.R](/_targets.R): target pipeline
-   [:page_facing_up: renv.lock](/renv.lock): renv lockfile

The dependency graph for our pipeline is shown below

## Acknowledgements

We recognize that the species and ecosystems we studied are within the
ancestral and present-day environs of the Inupiat and Yup’ik people who,
through many uncredited contributions of traditional knowledge, provided
early western naturalists and scientists with much of what gets
described as the ‘basic biology’ of Arctic seals. The deployment of
bio-logging devices used in this study were often done in collaboration
with Alaska Native seal hunters near their communities. We would like to
especially acknowledge the communities of Kotzebue, Koyuk, Nome,
Nuiqsut, Scammon Bay, St. Michael, Utqiaġvik, and Ulguniq (Wainwright)
and the following individuals: James Adams, Jeff Barger, David Barr,
Wendell Booth, Cyrus Harris, Nereus ‘Doc’ Harris, Grover Harris, Lee
Harris, Tom Jones, Frank Garfield, Brenda Goodwin, Henry Goodwin, John
Goodwin, Pearl Goodwin, Willie Goodwin, Brett Kirk, Noah Naylor, Virgil
Naylor Jr., Virgil Naylor Sr., Dan Savetilik, Chuck Schaeffer, Ross
Schaeffer, Allen Stone, and Randy Toshavik from Kotzebue, Alaska; Merlin
Henry from Koyuk, Alaska; Tom Gray from Nome; Vernon Long and Richard
Tukle from Nuiqsuit, Alaska; Morgan Simon, River Simon, and Al Smith
from Scammon Bay, Alaska; Alex Niksik Jr. from St. Michael, Alaska;
Billy Adams, James Aiken, Tim Aiken, Howard Kittick, Gilbert Leavitt,
Isaac Leavitt, J.R. Leavitt, and Joe Skin from Utqiaġvik, Alaska; Mary
Ellen Ahmaogak, Enoch Oktollik, Shawn Oktollik, Stacey Osborn, and Fred
Rexford from Ulguniq, Alaska.

We are grateful for the assistance in catching and sampling seals by
Ryan Adam, James Bailey, Michelle Barbieri, John Bengtson, Gavin Brady,
Vladamir Burkanov, Cynthia Christman, Sarah Coburn, Shawn Dahle, Rob
Delong, Stacy DiRocco, Deb Fauquier, Shannon Fitzgerald, Kathy Frost,
Scott Gende, Tracey Goldstein, Jeff Harris, Jason Herreman, Markus
Horning, John Jansen, Shawn Johnson, Charles Littnan, Lloyd Lowry, Brett
McClintock, Erin Moreland, Mark Nelson, Justin Olnes, Lorrie Rea, Bob
Shears, Gay Sheffield, Brent Stewart, Dave Withrow, and Heather Ziel. We
also appreciate the commitment to science and safety by all officers and
crew of the NOAA Ship Oscar Dyson, the NOAA Ship MacArthur II, and the
RV Thomas G. Thompson.

Telemetry data from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) and
the North Slope Borough Department of Wildlife Management (NSB) were
important contributions to the findings presented here. Both agencies
collaborate closely with Alaska Native communities and the contributions
of local hunters to the successful capture, deployment, and
understanding of seal ecology are invaluable. Deployments in the western
Bering Sea were done in collaboration with Russian colleagues and North
Pacific Wildlife.

## Inspiration

I would like to provide special acknowledgement to Ben Marwick and Carl
Boetinger. This research compendium borrows heavily from Ben’s
[{rrtools}](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools) package. Carl’s
example research compendiums
(<https://github.com/cboettig/noise-phenomena> and
<https://github.com/cboettig/nonparametric-bayes>) were also of great
use when adapting the structure to meet my needs.
