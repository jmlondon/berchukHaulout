This repository contains the research compendium in support of the above
titled paper. The manuscript is currently in preparation and the text,
code, analysis, and results are under active development.

## Draft Manuscript Under Active Development

Please note this manuscript is still in draft form and under active
development. Changes to results, code, and the manuscript are likely and
this **should not be cited without author permission**. We plan to
provide a preprint to [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) once internal
NOAA reviews and final revisions are completed.

## Contents

The **analysis** directory contains:

-   [:file_folder: paper](/analysis/paper): R Markdown source document
    for manuscript. Includes code to reproduce the figures and tables
    generated by the analysis. It also has a rendered MS Word version,
    `London_HauloutBehavior.docx`, suitable for reading (the code is
    replaced by figures and tables in this file)
-   [:file_folder: figures](/analysis/figures): figures generated
-   [:file_folder: templates](/analysis/templates): template files and
    scripts.

The **data** directory contains

-   [:file_folder: data](/data): data used for model fits and final
    model output

### {targets} and {renv} packages

This repository relies heavily on the {targets} and {renv} packages for
management of analysis pipelines and reproducibility.

-   [:file_folder: R](/R): pipeline functions developed in support of
    target pipeline
-   [:page_facing_up: \_targets.R](/_targets.R): target pipeline
-   [:page_facing_up: renv.lock](/renv.lock): renv lockfile

The dependency graph for our pipeline is shown below

## Inspiration

I would like to provide special acknowledgement to Ben Marwick and Carl
Boetinger. This research compendium borrows heavily from Ben’s
[{rrtools}](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools) package. Carl’s
example research compendiums
(<https://github.com/cboettig/noise-phenomena> and
<https://github.com/cboettig/nonparametric-bayes>) were also of great
use when adapting the structure to meet my needs.
