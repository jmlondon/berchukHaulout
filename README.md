This repository contains the research compendium in support of the above
titled paper. The manuscript is currently in preparation and the text,
code, analysis, and results are under active development.

## Contents

The **analysis** directory contains:

-   [:file_folder: paper](/analysis/paper): R Markdown source document
    for manuscript. Includes code to reproduce the figures and tables
    generated by the analysis. It also has a rendered version,
    `London_HauloutBehavior.docx`, suitable for reading (the code is
    replaced by figures and tables in this file)
-   [:file_folder: figures](/analysis/figures): figures generated
-   [:file_folder: scripts](/analysis/scripts): R scripts in support of
    analysis.
-   [:file_folder: templates](/analysis/templates): template files and
    scripts.

The **data** directory contains

-   [:file_folder: data](/data): data used for model fits and final
    model output

### {targets} and {renv} packages

This repository relies heavily on the {targets} and {renv} packages for
management of analysis pipelines and reproducibility.

-   [:file_folder: R](/R): pipeline functions developed in support of
    target pipeline
-   [:page_facing_up: \_targets.R](/_targets.R): target pipeline
-   [:page_facing_up: renv.lock](/renv.lock): renv lockfile

The dependency graph for our pipeline is shown below

    #> [conflicted] Will prefer dplyr::select over any other package
    #> [conflicted] Will prefer dplyr::filter over any other package
    #> [conflicted] Will prefer dplyr::sql over any other package
    #> [conflicted] Will prefer lubridate::month over any other package
