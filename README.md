## Acknowledgements

We recognize that the species and ecosystems we studied are within the ancestral
and present-day environs of the Inupiat and Yup'ik people who, through many
uncredited contributions of traditional knowledge, provided early western
naturalists and scientists with much of what gets described as the ‘basic
biology’ of Arctic seals. The deployment of bio-logging devices used in this
study were often done in collaboration with Alaska Native seal hunters and wiht the
approval of
their communities. We would like to especially acknowledge the Alaska communities of
Kotzebue, Koyuk, Nome, Nuiqsut, Scammon Bay, St. Michael, Utqiaġvik, and Ulguniq
(Wainwright) and the following individuals: James Adams, Jeff Barger, David
Barr, Wendell Booth, Cyrus Harris, Nereus 'Doc' Harris, Grover Harris, Lee
Harris, Tom Jones, Frank Garfield, Brenda Goodwin, Henry Goodwin, John Goodwin,
Pearl Goodwin, Willie Goodwin, Brett Kirk, Noah Naylor, Virgil Naylor Jr.,
Virgil Naylor Sr., Dan Savetilik, Chuck Schaeffer, Ross Schaeffer, Allen Stone,
and Randy Toshavik from Kotzebue; Merlin Henry from Koyuk; Tom
Gray from Nome; Vernon Long and Richard Tukle from Nuiqsuit; Morgan
Simon, River Simon, and Al Smith from Scammon Bay; Alex Niksik Jr. from
St. Michael; Billy Adams, James Aiken, Tim Aiken, Howard Kittick,
Gilbert Leavitt, Isaac Leavitt, J.R. Leavitt, Bobby Sarren, and Joe Skin from Utqiaġvik; 
Mary Ellen Ahmaogak, Enoch Oktollik, Shawn Oktollik, Stacey Osborn, and
Fred Rexford from Ulguniq. We would also like to acknowledge the support of the
Ice Seal Committee.

We are grateful for the assistance in catching and sampling seals by Ryan Adam,
James Bailey, Michelle Barbieri, John Bengtson, Gavin Brady, Anna Bryan,

officers and crew of the NOAA ship _Oscar Dyson_, the NOAA ship _MacArthur II_,
the _MV Tayfun_, and the RV _Thomas G. Thompson_.

Telemetry data from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) and the North
Slope Borough Department of Wildlife Management (NSB) were important
contributions to the findings presented here. Deployments in the western Bering
Sea were done in collaboration with Russian colleagues and North Pacific
Wildlife Consulting, LLC.

## Inspiration

I would like to provide special acknowledgement to Ben Marwick and Carl
Boetinger. This research compendium borrows heavily from Ben’s
[{rrtools}](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools) package. Carl’s
example research compendiums
(<https://github.com/cboettig/noise-phenomena> and
<https://github.com/cboettig/nonparametric-bayes>) were also of great
use when adapting the structure to meet my needs.
