## How to run in your broswer or download and run locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical
programming language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R
software](https://cloud.r-project.org/) itself and optionally [RStudio
Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

The simplest way (not yet enabled) to explore the text, code and data is
to click on
[binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh///master?urlpath=rstudio) to open an
instance of RStudio in your browser, which will have the compendium
files ready to work with. Binder uses rocker-project.org Docker images
to ensure a consistent and reproducible computational environment. These
Docker images can also be used locally.

<!-- You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL: -->
<!-- [master.zip](/archive/master.zip). After unzipping: -->
<!-- - open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio -->
<!-- - run `devtools::install()` to ensure you have the packages this analysis depends on (also listed in the -->
<!-- [DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file). -->
<!-- - finally, open `analysis/paper/paper.Rmd` and knit to produce the `paper.docx`, or run `rmarkdown::render("analysis/paper/paper.Rmd")` in the R console -->
